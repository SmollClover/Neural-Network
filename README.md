# Neural Network

## A basic implementation of a Neural Network using TypeScript.

### Disclaimer:

This Repo is just for some tinkering I am doing on Neural Networks and AI.

### Includes (will include):

-   Matrix with Matrix Math functions
-   Basic class for a Neural Network
-   Multi-Layer support
-   Variable number of Input, Output and Hidden Layers
-   Easy way of exporting and importing data
    -   Matrix
    -   Learned Data
-   A way of continuing learning from last point

### ToDo:

-   [ ] Matrix
    -   [x] Add as class
    -   [ ] Better way of storing Matrix data
    -   [ ] Matrix Math functions
-   [ ] Neural Network
    -   [ ] Add as class
    -   [ ] Perceptrons
    -   [ ] Multi-Layer
    -   [ ] Variable Inputs, Outputs and Hidden Layers
